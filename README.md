# Mouse Finder

Mouse Finder is a fun replacement for the system Finder icon in the Dock. It mostly works exactly like the system icon, with one important difference — the eyes follow your mouse pointer. Here’s a [video](https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1362179114204073984) of it in action.

## Installation
Download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/neilsardesai/Mouse-Finder/releases/download/v1.0/Finder.zip), move the app to the Applications folder, then open it. You may also want to [keep it in the Dock](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/dock-mh35859/mac) and have it [open at login](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-items-automatically-when-you-log-in-mh15189/mac).

## Hiding the System Finder Icon
At this point you’ll have two Finder icons in your Dock — the real Finder icon, and the one from Mouse Finder. One way to hide the system Finder icon is using an app called [cDock](https://www.macenhance.com/cdock). If you know any more ways to hide the system Finder icon, [let me know](mailto:NeilS@rdes.ai), and I’ll add them to this page.

## Background
This project is a fun look at pushing the limits of the [NSDockTile](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktile) API. The API was likely never meant to be used this way, so you’ll find the code does get a bit hacky. The app itself, however, is pretty delightful, and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I do :)
